            During the COVID period, it has become more common for <br /> many
            people to do their work and leisure activities on the <br />{" "}
            Internet. Through voice chat, while looking at each otherâ€™s <br />
            faces, we are able to perform activities that are more realistic{" "}
            <br />
            than before. Not only conferences but also presentations, social{" "}
            <br />
            parties, dating, shopping, gaming and more can be easily held <br />{" "}
            online. <SentenceP></SentenceP> You can use the video conferencing
            service just by depositing <br /> NXDF or GNXD in your wallet.
            NXDF-Meet You can be with your <br /> friends in real-time no matter
            which metaverse you are <br /> connected to. NXDF-Meet We open
            source and API to become <br /> a service for all metaverses around
            the world, not just for the <br /> NXDF ecosystem.
